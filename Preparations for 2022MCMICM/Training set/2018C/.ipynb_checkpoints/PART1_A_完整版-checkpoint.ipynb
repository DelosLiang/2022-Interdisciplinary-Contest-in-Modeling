In addition to this, it is not difficult to see from the graph that the growth in total electricity consumption in New Mexico and Arizona is much more moderate compared to the changes in total electricity consumption in California and Texas. Finally, we can also see that around 1978 Texas surpassed California in total electricity consumption."

    "We know that clean energy can be divided into renewable energy and non-renewable energy, among which the representative of non-renewable clean energy is natural gas. With the growing concern about climate change, people have begun to realize that traditional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, etc., release a lot of harmful gases during the combustion process, so people have begun to seek their alternatives. Compared with traditional fossil fuels, natural gas has the characteristics of easy storage (very high storage efficiency in the case of pressurized liquefaction), less pollution, and abundant reserves. At the same time, natural gas is more abundant and more energy supply than other new renewable energy sources. It is convenient and fast, and the cost of transportation by pipeline is also very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection, we select four states that have fluctuated in the average price of natural gas over the past 50 years to reflect the use of natural gas in each state. Seasonality plays an important role in analyzing natural gas supply and demand. It helps gas producers, storage facilities and energy utilities manage inventory risk, as well as financial price risk in the marketplace. Natural gas production is relatively stable, but there can be unexpected disruptions, such as temporary repairs, explosions or extreme weather. Seasonality has little effect on changes in natural gas production. Stocks and consumption often exhibit seasonal patterns, with relatively high price elasticity. That is, natural gas storage and consumption can quickly respond to market price fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We plotted data over the past five decades for four states as a scatterplot and projected natural gas price changes from 2010 to 2025. We present the graph in **Figure 4**. It can be seen from the figure that the natural gas price fluctuations of the four states in the past 50 years are basically the same, but they are not completely the same. We think this is related to the federal system of the United States, but each state has its own unique situation and its own independent state government and energy sector. From the change trend of the scatter points in the figure, we can see that the natural gas prices in the four states showed an upward trend from 1970 to 1985 and from 2000 to 2008, and the prices basically changed little in the middle of about fifteen years. It's worth noting that natural gas prices in all four states dropped significantly in 2009, and I think something must have caused this common mutation. We also made predictions for the next 16 years based on previous data. Taking California as an example, excluding the impact of other emergencies, we can predict that natural gas prices in California may drop to $4.9 per million Btu in 2023."
