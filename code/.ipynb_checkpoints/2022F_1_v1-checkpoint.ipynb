    "First, in order to give the definition of global equity, we constructed the indicator system as shown in **figure 1**. We selected seven major categories of indicators, namely, Social development, Economic development, Mineral resouces, Environmental conditions, Science and technology and Trade situation. At the social level, we selected population as our measure, and at the economic level, We chose GDP as the standard. Considering that the current power generation is basically fueled by fossil energy, we choose the electricity consumption of each region as the standard. We all know that the mining of minerals will bring serious environmental pollution and emit a lot of harmful gases [1], so we choose carbon monoxide and methane emissions to measure the environmental status of a region. In principle, the resources in space do not belong to any country, but in the process of space mining in the future, human beings will definitely encounter the problem of distribution of the benefits brought by space mining. Usually, a country contributes more to space mining. technology, they deserve more in return. Therefore, technology is a factor that cannot be ignored. We selected three factors: Number of R & D researchers, High tech export and Sci tech journal articles to measure a country's technological strength. Finally, a country's energy import and export situation should also be taken into account. The higher a country's dependence on energy imports, the more the country should be favored by the policy of the space energy program. In particular, all our raw data are downloaded from the website *https://data.worldbank.org.cn/*."

While according to the research, findings from various countries confirm the positive effect of ICT on GDP growth. What's more, population growth, because it places increased pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment, is also viewed as a major cause of air, water, and solid-waste pollution. Furthermore，The relationship between population pressures and deforestation to create arable land is clearly affected by the use of modern agricultural technology, which reduces land requirements. n order to obtain the relationship between the importance of the environment, energy consumption and fuel imports, we find that Energy consumption and energy imports are of roughly equal importance[6].
