    "First, as we can see in the figure, we measure global equity in two broad categories. The first category is population happiness, which includes education spending as a percentage of GDP, life expectancy, electrification rate, and proportion of urban residents. According to relevant research, these four factors contribute significantly to population happiness[1] . The second category is strength development, which consists of forest area, government spending as a percentage of GDP, PPP-adjusted national income per capita and R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. According to the results of literature review, we believe that these four Factors are sufficient to summarize the degree of development of a region [2]. We will calculate the weights of these factors in the following parts, and finally get a region-based indicator system for measuring global equity. Using this indicator system, we can calculate the value of the overall strength of each region. Finally, we use the root mean square obtained from this set of values as our index to measure global equity."

    "**ARIMA Model**, that is, differential autoregressive moving average model, is one of the methods of time-domain analysis of time series. Time-domain analysis of time series reveals the development law of time series from the perspective of sequence autocorrelation, mainly including AR model, MA model, ARIMA model, autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model and its derivative models. ARIMA model is a method developed on the basis of AR model and MA model.\n",

At the same time, compared with arch model and its derivative model, this model has the characteristics of simple structure and less input variables, It is one of the most widely used methods for univariate time series data prediction, which is convenient for business promotion. ARIMA model is recorded as $ARIMA (p, d, q)$, where $p$ is the order of AR model, $q$ is the order of MA model, and $d$ is the difference order. The general expression of the model is as follows:\n",

In the entropy weight method, information entropy is the most commonly used indicator to measure the purity of a sample set.

Therefore, determining the weight of the indicator system is the basis of system evaluation[2]. We calculated the information entropy scores for all regions and placed the weight of eight indicators via the entropy weight method in **Figure 4**."
